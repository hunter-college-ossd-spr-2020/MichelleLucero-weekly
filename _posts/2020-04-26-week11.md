After hearing Brasseur's talk, I read [Open Source is Not for You](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9) with a new perspective. When Rich states,

>"You are not entitled to the attention of others. You are not entitled to having value attached to your complaints. You are not entitled to this explanation."

it made me think about the developer centrism Brasseur mentioned. Reading the atricle a second time, I feel as if Rich limits the types of users he gets to users that share his vision, thereby decreasing the FOSS usage and adpotion. Rich's belief that users are not "entitled" to an explanation is disheartening to read as receiving no feedback can be discouraging to users. As Brasseur mentioned, there's users that don't mean malice but are simply ignorant. Telling an ignorant user why they're in the wrong rather than chatise may go a long way.
