**List of OSS I found Interesting**
 - [OpenCV](https://github.com/opencv?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=readme&type=&language=)

 For the past two months, I've been interested in computer vision. When I heard about the OpenCV project, I thought *what better way to learn about computer vision than by contributing to this project?* Captivated by the software's relation to self-driving cars, I was disappointed to discover that the code of conduct file was no where to be seen. Therefore, I had to eliminate this as an option.

 - [Umbrella](https://github.com/securityfirst/Umbrella_android)

 Umbrella's purpose is to protect aid workers, journalists, and activists by managing their security both physically and digitally. Intrigued by the cause, I looked into the project's GitHub repo and discovered that not only was Umbrella missing files, but it also didn't have a lot of issues or activity going on. I had to eliminate this option due to inactivity and missing essential files such as the code of conduct.

 - [Open Data Kit](https://github.com/opendatakit)

 Open Data Kit (ODK) makes collecting data in resource-constrained environments easier. According to its [website](http://opendatakit.org/), ODK monitors "rainforests to observing elections to tracking outbreaks". Fortunately, ODK has all four files: contributing, readme, license, and code of conduct. ODK's issue tracker has a good amount of "good first issue", which are good for newcomers. Therefore, ODK remains an option.

**Contributions to OSS**

In OSM, I outlined buildings, added restaurants and supermarkets. Interestingly, OSM doesn't seem to be up to date in my neighborhood as it shows an empty lot which became a gas station. Nevertheless, I added the gas station.
