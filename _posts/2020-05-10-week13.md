I completed the homepage for our pet care application and submitted a [PR](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/next.js/pull/22) to Hunter/Next.js. In the homepage, I included pet cards that displays a pet's image, owner, and likes. I was able to display the pet's info by using a package called isomorphic-unfetch, which allows users to fetch input and update/add data from a database such as MongoDB.
