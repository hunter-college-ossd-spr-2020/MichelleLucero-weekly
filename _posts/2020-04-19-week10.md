- Open Source = Job

Yehuda mentioned that open source can get you a job. For example, let's say a company needs someone that is an expert in Kubernetes that company can simply go to Kubernetes's repo and select a contributor of their choice. 

- Open Source was anti-corporation

At the beginning of the open source movement, the idea was to free software from corporations. Now, it's implemented into corporate practice as it allows companies to save their resources.

- Imposter syndrome

Everyone has it, just some are better at hiding it than others. The way to conceal the ubiquitous conditon is to keep developing your skills. Then you too can hide it well!


:pill: Folding@Home's Covid19 Activity

This reminds me of a similar project that needed a picture of space analyzed, which requires a lot of computing power. They also relied on volunteered computer resource. It's amazing how one can contribute with a simple installation that can lead to groundbreaking results, especially with current issues such as COVID-19. I volunteered computing power in hopes that Folding@Home is able to find a druggable site within COVID-19 as they did with Ebola.
