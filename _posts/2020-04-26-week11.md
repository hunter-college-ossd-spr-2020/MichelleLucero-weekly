After hearing Brasseur's talk, I read [Open Source is Not for You](https://gist.github.com/richhickey/1563cddea1002958f96e7ba9519972d9) with a new perspective. When Rich states:
>"You are not entitled to features. You are not entitled to the attention of others. You are not entitled to having value attached to  your complaints. You are not entitled to this explanation."
