Before hearing from Fleming, I knew Bloomberg was a company that focuses on financial data. However, I did not know that some of their customers depend on on Bloomberg tool to do their jobs. For example, the Bank of England had planned to sell government bonds but was unable to because Bloomberg was having issues. I found the "Card Sorting excercise" interesting as I had no knowledge in how companies perform product evaulations. For the "Card Sorting excercise", a test for menu structure, Bloomberg uses eye detection technology to figure out where people are looking at on the menus.

For wikipedia contributions, I've been focusing on adding pictures to Wikipedia articles and Wikimedia Commons. Looking through Wikipedia articles,  I've discovered that there's a lack of details to articles involving Ecuador. Thus, I've decided to go through these articles and add info (if I find reputable sources) and photos. As I mentioned in my previous blog, I went to Ecuador in 2018 and took photos of attractions from cities I've visited there. So, I put some of my images up on Wikimedia Commons and then added them to relevant articles. Now, I'm at a point where I don't have any photos that I can obviously use on articles so I'm left to scour through Wikimedia Commons to find pictures for articles. The issue with relying on Wikimedia Common for images is that you'll possibly go through hundred of pictures before you find one that satisfies you. There will be cases where you won't be satisfy as the picture could not exist or is of poor quality.
