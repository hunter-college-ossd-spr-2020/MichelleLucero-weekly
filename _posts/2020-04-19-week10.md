- Open Source = Job
Yehuda mentioned that open source can get you a job. For example, let's say a company needs someone that is an expert of Kubernetes that company can simply go to kubernetes's repo and select a contributor of their choice. 

- Open Source was anti-corporation
At the beginning of the open source movement, the idea was to free software from corporations. Now, it's implemented into corporate practice as it allows companies to save their resources.

- Imposter syndrome
Everyone has it, just some are better at hiding it than others. The way to conceal the ubiquitous coniditon is to keep developing your skills than you too can hide it well!
