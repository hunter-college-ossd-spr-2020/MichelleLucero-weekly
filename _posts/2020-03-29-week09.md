Before hearing from Fleming, I knew Bloomberg was a company that focuses on financial data. However, I did not know that some of their customers depend on on Bloomberg tool to do their jobs. For example, the Bank of England had planned to sell government bonds but was unable to because Bloomberg was having issues. I found the "Card Sorting excercise" interesting as I had no knowledge in how companies perform product evaulations. For the "Card Sorting excercise", a test for menu structure, Bloomberg uses eye detection technology to figure out where people are looking at on the menus.
