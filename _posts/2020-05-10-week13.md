Thoughts on "Makers and Takers" by Dries Buytaert
---
I have to agree with Buytaert, that extreme takers turn makers into takers. Thus, hurting the open source project in the process. A way to avoid the imbalance of makers and takers, Buyaert suggests applying centralization, privitazation, and self-governance to open source projects. I don't necessarily agree with applying privitazation to open source as such a model could lock out other potential investors.

I completed the homepage for our pet care application and submitted a [PR](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/next.js/pull/22) to Hunter/Next.js. In the homepage, I included pet cards that displays a pet's image, owner, and likes. I was able to display the pet's info by using a package called isomorphic-unfetch, which allows users to fetch input and update/add data from a database such as MongoDB.

Liulan alerted me that I had given our pet seed data a broken link. I promptly [fixed](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/next.js/pull/23) the broken link to my dog's photo on wikimedia commons and edited my dog's dislikes.
