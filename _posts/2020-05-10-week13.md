I completed the homepage for our pet care application and submitted a [PR](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/next.js/pull/22) to Hunter/Next.js.

I was able to display the pet's info by using a package called isomorphic-unfetch, which allows users to fetch input and update/add data from a database such as MongoDB.

Liulan alerted me that I had given our pet seed data a broken link. I promptly [fixed](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr-2020/next.js/pull/23) the broken link to my dog's photo on wikimedia commons and edited my dog's dislikes.
