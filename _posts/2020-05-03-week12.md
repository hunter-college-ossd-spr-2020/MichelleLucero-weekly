Musings on business models for open source software
---

In the case of Adobe customers, their experience can be explained from Callaway's quote:

>"Customers get wedged in a painful state where it is even more painful to abandon the software, trapped in a poor experience and growing to despise their vendors."

Adobe has failed their customers with their buggy products. Unfortunately, most creative professionals rely on Adobe products to do their jobs. These customers have to rely on Adobe to fix its own issues, which means they may or may not fix them and if they do it may take awhile.

Looking at how much Adobe customers [despise](https://community.adobe.com/t5/get-started/adobe-your-products-suck/td-p/8138834?page=1) Adobe, makes me see the beauty of open source. With an open source model, you have the power to change the source code. No longer will you have to wait on propietary software developers.
